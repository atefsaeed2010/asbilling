# Licensing #

Newfies-Dialer has been released under the Mozilla Public License, Version 2, (MPL V2) as described at http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/

The MPL license is commercially friendly in that it allows companies to combine their own closed source development with Newfies-Dialer without the perceived limitations of some open source licenses.

Furthermore, the MPL makes provision to allow improvements to the software to be passed upstream to us for the benefit of all users of Newfies-Dialer.


# Rebranding #

The asbilling splash page can be rebranded to suit your corporate image and we can do this for you, please contact us for more details.

# Alternative Licensing #

A company may, perfectly reasonably, want to make a derivative proprietary commercial application from asbilling or combine asbilling with another larger application, and completely white-label asbilling, and the MPL may not be suitable for their requirements.

In this case, we would ask you to contact us with your plan for asbilling, and discuss options with us, which may simply result in a written permission, e.g. to remove the copyright, or re-license asbilling for your particular application. Naturally, the costs can vary depending on your requirements.

If you have any questions on licensing, or you are unsure of your obligations under the MPL, please contact us for clarification.
